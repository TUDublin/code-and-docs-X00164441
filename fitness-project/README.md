# Project Research

Section 1: Detailed Discussion

I have decided in doing a General Health & Fitness Tracker mobile app for my project. 
As a general overview, I aim to create an app that has incorporated features like that 
of many popular health & wellness apps such as MyFitnessPal, Calm, Headspace, 
Zero, Happy Scale etc. with aspects of many popular fitness and workout apps such 
as Strong, Strava, Runkeeper etc.

The app will serve as an amalgamation of most of the apps mentioned above and will 
be used to do a myriad of things such as calorie tracking: tracking the caloric amount 
of the foods you’ve eaten across a day, tracking your water intake, meal and snack 
planning, measuring your different body measurements: such as your waist 
circumference, hip circumference etc. and comparing it to prior measurements. 
Tracking your weight: a dedicated weight logbook that calculates your moving 
average, your weekly rate, and a graph supporting your weight loss or gain trend. 
There will also be a daily meal diary to track more specifically what you’ve eaten. A 
structure for your different workouts and a way to choose from more established 
workout plans. I would also strive to add barcode scanning for different food items to 
help with calorie tracking and tracking what you’ve eaten in your daily meal diary
and finally, if possible, customized meal and workout plans based on user input and 
info.

If possible and time permits, I will also add abilities to track your fasting hours if you 
practice different fasting methods such as intermittent fasting. There will be 
capabilities to allow you to meditate and relax with guided breathing exercises. 
Hopefully, a dedicated running segment that allows you to track your runs over a 
long period of time and compare different major and minor statistics such as your 
increase or decrease in overall pace, comparing your fast mile to your slowest mile 
for example and insights to see whether you are progressing.
This mobile app would be suitable for the average person looking to improve their 
physical or mental health or their diet and negative lifestyle habits to the more 
devout health enthusiast looking for more general data over a wider avenue and to 
have everything in the one app.

Section 3: Platform, Technologies and Libraries

I plan to build out my project for mobile devices using React Native. I plan to use
Firebase Auth for user management and other backend databases, different React 
Native packages such as react-native-chart-kit for charts & graphs. I will grab my 
application data from different sources such as Irish Government Data, FoodData 
Central, Muscle and Strength, Openfoodfacts etc.

Section 4: The risks

I believe the main risk of this project would be trying to implement too much 
functionality. I believe this could result in rushed code which would lead to a poor 
quality of code and a ton of bugs, logical errors etc. Expanding on from that, I feel 
there could very well be an issue of scope creep, allowing the project to morph into 
something completely different than what I initially expected it to be. With that 
being said, I feel it’s very important to separate my project out into manageable 
segments and iterations and to frequently review my scope and implement one
piece of functionality and one feature at a time whilst also frequently testing them.
With how much functionality I’d like to add, there is also the risk of the project 
turning into a too complex multi-part project and the implementation of project 
functionality and features being more difficult to implement than expected. One 
technique I aim to take conscious note of to prevent these aforementioned risks is 
setting SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely.
I also take note in understanding that it won’t be possible to completely avoid certain 
risks and the risks mentioned above, sometimes it is only possible to mitigate them 
and their effects, so it’s equally important to have good risk management by 
identifying potential risks, calculating the likelihood of each risk, having risk 
mitigation plans and carefully monitoring risks as I moved forward with my project.
There is also a risk of inadequate project management and just how it’s important to 
practice good risk management, it’s equally important to practice good project 
management. I aim to do so by utilizing different project management software,
developing clear-cut project plans, liaising with my project supervisor frequently with 
clear communication and having an elaborate documentation process.
